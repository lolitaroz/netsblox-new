                  The aim of ROCCEM is to provide middle school educators with
                  accessible, focused, and engaging educational material for
                  schools across Tennessee and beyond. Using NetsBlox, a
                  block-based programming environment, the ROCCEM curriculum
                  introduces students to robotics, cybersecurity, and advanced
                  computer science concepts without the text-based programming
                  hurdle. The work is based on a previous effort targeting high
                  school students using physical robots as described in this
                  paper. To avoid dependence on physical hardware, we use a 3D
                  robotic simulation environment, called RoboScape Online (RO).
                  An overview is provided in this paper. The intuitive design
                  and public accessibility of NetsBlox and RO enable educators
                  to utilize the curriculum with virtually no hurdles. The
                  9-week long ROCCEM curriculum is divided into four modules:
